# mlflow_ts

The 'mlflow_ts' project was generated by using the default-python template.

## Getting started

3. To deploy a development copy of this project, type:

   ```
   $ databricks bundle deploy --target dev
   ```

   (Note that "dev" is the default target, so the `--target` parameter
   is optional here.)

   This deploys everything that's defined for this project.
   For example, the default template would deploy a job called
   `[dev yourname] mlflow_ts_job` to your workspace.
   You can find that job by opening your workpace and clicking on **Workflows**.

4. To run a job or pipeline, use the "run" command:
   ```
   $ databricks bundle run
   ```
